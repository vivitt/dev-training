# Nailing Planks

In this exercise, the input consists of two non-empty arrays of N integers, A and B, representing the starting and ending positions of planks.
There is also a third array of integers, C, representing the positions of nails. A plank is considered nailed if there exists an element C[i] such that `A[k] ≤ C[i] ≤ B[k]`.
The goal is to find the minimum number of nails, used in order, that are enough to nail all the planks represented by A and B.
