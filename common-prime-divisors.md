# Common Prime Divisors

In this exercise, the goal is to count how many pairs of integers have exactly the same number of prime divisors.
A prime number X is called a prime divisor of a positive integer Y if it can be multiplied by some other positive integer Z such that `X * Z = Y`.

The solution function receives two arrays, A and B, of the same length, and must return the number of pairs where A[i] and B[i] have exactly the same number of prime divisors.
