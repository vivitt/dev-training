# Algorithm & Coding Challenges Solutions

Created this repo to store and track my progress in solving programming and algorithm challenges from various online platforms.

1. [In this exercise, you start with N counters, all set to 0.](array-of-counters.md)
2. [The goal of this task is to create a function to determine whether an array of N integers is a permutation.](find-array-permutations.md)
3. [The goal of this problem is to find the array index that represents the first time all integers from 1 to X have appeared in the array.](find-first-complete-set.md)
4. [The goal of this exercise is to write a function that receives an array of integers and returns the first index of the slice with the minimal average sum. The average sum is calculated by dividing the sum of the elements by the number of elements in the slice.](find-minimal-average.md)
5. [The goal of this exercise is to find the missing element in an array.](find-missing-array-element.md)
6. [The goal of this exercise is to find the smallest positive integer missing from an array.](find-smallest-integer.md)
7. [The goal of this exercise is to find the minimal possible difference between two parts of a split non-empty array.](minimal-difference.md)
8. [In this exercise, the goal is to create a function that answers multiple queries.](nucleotides-minimal-impact-factors.md)
9. [In this exercise, the solution function receives three arguments: A, B, and K.](number-of-divisible-integers.md)
